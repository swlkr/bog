## Development

Open a terminal and type `lein repl` to start a Clojure REPL
(interactive prompt).

In the REPL, type

```clojure
(run)
(browser-repl)
```

The call to `(run)` starts the Figwheel server at port 3449, which takes care of
live reloading ClojureScript code and CSS. Figwheel's server will also act as
your app server, so requests are correctly forwarded to the http-handler you
define.

Running `(browser-repl)` starts the Figwheel ClojureScript REPL. Evaluating
expressions here will only work once you've loaded the page, so the browser can
connect to Figwheel.

When you see the line `Successfully compiled "resources/public/app.js" in 21.36
seconds.`, you're ready to go. Browse to `http://localhost:3449` and enjoy.

**Attention: It is not needed to run `lein figwheel` separately. Instead we
launch Figwheel directly from the REPL**

## Testing

To run the Clojure tests, use

``` shell
lein test
```

To run the Clojurescript you use [doo](https://github.com/bensu/doo). This can
run your tests against a variety of JavaScript implementations, but in the
browser and "headless". For example, to test with PhantomJS, use

``` shell
lein doo phantom
```

## Deploying to Heroku

This assumes you have a
[Heroku account](https://signup.heroku.com/dc), have installed the
[Heroku toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/), and have done a
`heroku login` before.

``` sh
git init
git add -A
git commit
heroku create
git push heroku master:master
heroku open
```

## Running with Foreman

Heroku uses [Foreman](http://ddollar.github.io/foreman/) to run your
app, which uses the `Procfile` in your repository to figure out which
server command to run. Heroku also compiles and runs your code with a
Leiningen "production" profile, instead of "dev". To locally simulate
what Heroku does you can do:

``` sh
lein with-profile -dev,+production uberjar && foreman start
```

Now your app is running at
[http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) in production mode.
